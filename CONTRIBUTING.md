# Welcome to the Blink Labs contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community
approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from
opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Getting started

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some
resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

Blink Labs repositories use Conventional Commits for all commits. This defines
a standard format for commit messages across repositories and projects.

- [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS)

Blink Labs repositories use CODEOWNERS files to provide information on who
should review a contribution. For repositories with regular outside
contributors, they will be listed within this file in the repository or
repositories which they maintain.

<br>

Contributions to open source come in many forms. You can contribute to Blink
Labs projects in several ways.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with a project, search if an issue already exists. If a
related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue in the repository.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow
down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign
issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR
with a fix.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a
PR.
- Don't forget to
[link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to
[allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)
so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may
ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using
[suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request)
or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the
UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your
branch.
